# BanksDS

This project is my final project of Data Structure Course in Shahid Beheshti university at January 2022.  
A simple :)  Data Structure for :
- finding the nearest banks and their branches in your location by ***k-d tree***;
- searching in branches name by ***Trie tree***;
- searching in banks name by ***Hashing***;

### KD-tree :

### Trie-tree :

- [Trie tree EXPLAINED (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-urNrIAQnNo&t=78s)

### Hashing :
    For hashing I just add index of array for Banks Object in BankBranches list

> Notes:  
    - Implementation of the KD-tree is inside the BankBranch Object;  
    - Implementation of the Trie-tree is outside the BankBranch Object;
