# BanksDS

This project was my final project of Data Structure Course in Shahid Beheshti university at January 2022.
I practiced k-d tree, trie tree, hashing and implementing multiple data structure for one object.


## About Data Structure of this project
- **Branches By KDTree**: Finding the nearest banks and their branches in your location by ***k-d tree***;  
- **Branches By TrieTree:** Searching in branches name by ***Trie tree***;
- **Neighbourhoods By ?**: 
- **Banks By TriTree:** Searching in banks name by ***Trie tree***;


> Notes:  
> This app is a runtime app and doesn't save the data in files and if app terminate, app data go away :).  
> bank branches should have a main bank;  
> banks can be out of any neighbourhood;  
> Implementation of the KD-tree is inside the BankBranch Object;  
> Implementation of the Trie-tree is outside the BankBranch Object;
